```

            "college_name": "Police Insitution"

        {

            "phone_number": "9999933333",
            "college_name": "Gangs of Wasseypur"
        },
    ]
}
```

### Testing Suite
Make sure to have RabbitMQ up - `docker compose up -d`

1. For testing WoC
```bash
bash scripts/insert_woc_data.sh
```

2. For testing AI-Verse
```bash
bash scripts/insert_hack_data.bash
```

This populates RabbitMQ. If you have receivers listening on the other end, 
then the dispatch would work.

To configure receivers, rename `env.sample.toml` to `env.toml` and populate 
the required details. Don't change the queue name as it is currently hardcoded
in the codebase. Ideally, it should be read from `env.toml`

Once, everything is configured, type - `make run` in your terminal.
